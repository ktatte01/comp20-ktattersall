I spent approximately 1.5 hours completing this assignment.

It is impossible to request data from a different origin or from your local
machine using XMLHttpRequest due to the same origin policy. The same origin

the two resources to interact. The policy was implemented to prevent malicious
security breaches in which information from one website could be supplied to 
another, less trustworthy website.

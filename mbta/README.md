Lab 10: MBTA (Part 2)

To my knowledge, all aspects of this work have been correctly implemented.

I have neither collaborated nor discussed this assignment with anyone.

I spent approximately 8.5 hours completing this assignment.


Notes:
This lab took exceptionally long for me to complete. I ran into several issues:
for starters, I had a lot of trouble trying to use loops. I spent a lot of
time trying to clean up my code by creating events for all of the markers in
one loop but eventually was not able to find a solution and ended up typing
it all out anyway. Frankly, I am embarrassed by how sloppy this code is 
and I normally clean it up and minimize it wherever I can, but I couldn't
seem to find a solution that would work for this one.

Also, when I was initially trying to just display my obj in the console to 
ensure that I had parsed the JSON data correctly, I got the same error over
and over again though I was sure that I had done it right. I realized then
that since it was close to 1 AM, the JSON API for each schedule was only 
generating four upcoming trains rather than the usual 10, so the next
morning, my code functioned perfectly. Still, a lot of time was wasted
trying to needlessly debug this. :(
